# Python-ML--Breast-Cancer-Prediction
I was part of an internship and training program that focused on Python Machine Learning, involving structured training sessions followed by the successful completion of  assigned projects in the field. The project of Breast cancer Prediction was one of them.

steps:
1. Import ,analyze and clean dataset and visualized diagnosis distribution.
2. Implemented Random Forest Classifier for predictive modeling.
3. Evaluated model accuracy and usability through user input interface.
4. Aimed to enhance early detection of breast cancer using machine learning techniques.
